"""What the application needs to stand on a public address.

Sign-in itself lives in admin_auth. This is everything around it: which host
names the site answers to, sending browsers to HTTPS, the headers that keep a
page from being framed or sniffed, reading the visitor's real address from
behind a reverse proxy, and refusing to start a production deployment that is
missing its secrets.

Settings, all optional in development:

    PHARMASEARCH_ENV               "production" turns the startup checks on
    PHARMASEARCH_ALLOWED_HOSTS     host names this site answers to, comma
                                   separated ("search.example.com")
    PHARMASEARCH_FORCE_HTTPS       "1" to redirect http to https and mark the
                                   session cookie Secure
    PHARMASEARCH_TRUSTED_PROXY     "1" when a reverse proxy in front sets
                                   X-Forwarded-Proto and X-Forwarded-For
