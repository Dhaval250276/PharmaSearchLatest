"""The molecule list that drives a source-wide harvest.

Only a handful of registries hand over their whole catalogue in one request.
The other connectors are search endpoints: they answer a molecule and nothing
else, so harvesting them without the user typing anything means supplying the
molecules ourselves.

The list is assembled from what we can already reach:

* the openFDA label facet, which returns the substance names of every US label
  ranked by how many labels carry them, in a single request;
* the cached CDSCO corpus, which is the Indian catalogue and names molecules
  that never reach a US label;
* the substances already sitting in product_details, so anything a user has
  searched stays covered.

Each entry keeps the sources it came from and an evidence count, so a harvest
can run the best-attested molecules first and stop wherever the operator wants
rather than having to finish the whole list to be useful.
